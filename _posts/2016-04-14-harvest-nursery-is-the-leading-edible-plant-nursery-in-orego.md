Harvest Nursery utilizes permaculture practices in the raising and caring for its plants and gardens. This means we don't use neonicotinoids, or any kind of pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers. Our practices involve feeding the soil and soil organisms, growing beneficial insectary plants to encourage ladybugs and other beneficial insects, growing flowers to provide food sources for bees, and much more. It also means we don't sell GMO plants of any kind. We plant our plants in our own gardens and feed the fruit from those plants to ourselves and our children. We grow our own food so that our families don't have to eat chemicals and GMOs. We want you to be confident that when you buy a plant from us you are feeding your family real food (not GMO food laced with chemicals).
